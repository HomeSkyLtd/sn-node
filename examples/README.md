#Examples

This folder contains a lot of examples. Before running any of them, do not forget to run `npm install` on its folder to
download the required libraries. To run any example, just type `node <EXAMPLE.JS>`, replaceing EXAMPLE.JS with the example you want to run.

You can simulate a Rainfall network on your computer with these examples, just run one controller (simple-controller, interactive-controller, complete-controller, ruled-controller), then some sensors and actuators and you are already seeing the power of the Rainfall protocol in action!


These examples are "ready to go", you can copy them, change what you need and use it!
